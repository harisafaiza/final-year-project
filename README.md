SUPPLEMENTARY TACTILE MATERIALS FOR VIB INDIVIDUALS USING IMAGE SEGMENTATION AND 2.5D PRINTING

This project aims to address the challenges faced by individuals with visual impairments by introducing an innovative approach to create tactile materials, enabling information acquisition through the sense of touch. The primary objectives include leveraging image segmentation and 2.5D printing technologies to transform natural images into tactile representations, fostering a rich and meaningful exploration of visual content. The project's scope encompasses the entire process, from image acquisition to user interface development, with a focus on maintaining essential details through image segmentation. The significance lies in enhancing accessibility, inclusivity, and engagement for visually impaired individuals, fostering independence and empowerment. Existing solutions often face limitations, and this project proposes an advanced methodology to overcome gaps, providing a more personalized and interactive tactile experience.

The technological landscape, incorporating AI and ML, aligns with broader advancements in accessibility. There is potential for educational integration, particularly in STEM subjects, contributing to educational inclusivity. Collaborative design principles, involving users and experts, ensure diverse perspectives are considered. Integration with augmented reality expands the project's impact, offering an enriched experience. Cultural sensitivity and adherence to evolving regulatory standards are prioritized. Environmental impact and considerations for long-term usability, maintenance, and ethical considerations, including privacy and dignity, are integral aspects. The project establishes a framework for continuous improvement through iterative feedback loops, allowing the methodology to evolve based on real-world usage and user experiences.
